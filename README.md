# ML_232
## Overview
This project focuses on the image classification task using MNIST database. 
## Dataset
MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.
## Programming Languages and Packages used
- Python
- Scikit Learn
- Keras
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
## Setup and Installation
Install all the required packages, dataset get from keras.
## Note
The notebook contains my primary work, the python files are summary of each model.
